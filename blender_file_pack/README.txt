These directories contain various Blender files used throughout the Beginning Blender book. Some of the files include links to textures or other items outside of the .blend file itself. If moving the files around, it is important to keep textures or other such dependencies intact. Don't move or rename internal folders, or links may be broken. Moving an entire chapter directory around should be okay.
